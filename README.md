# WaxusBS (Waxus Base System) is a free and open-source operating system

here I'm gonna share indev files/dirs

update on 2025/04/17 (it's 12:38 at the moment, btw): on prototype and alpha it may contain small pieces of Linux kernel code (and maybe, if I find it, BSD kernel). It will be used just to show people WaxusBS a little bit faster. In the future this code will be replaced with self-written code, just be sure
